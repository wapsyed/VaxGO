RNAseq is essential for studying transcriptional patterns in immunology, particularly in immunization research. We introduce VaxGO, a tool designed to enhance the understanding of immune processes, cell markers, and vaccination responses. Built on the Covid-19 Vaccination Atlas (link) study framework, VaxGO integrates data from Gene Ontology, CellMarker 2.0, MSigDB Vax collection, and other key studies. The tool is particularly useful for analyzing differentially expressed genes in immune contexts. VaxGO is an interactive, web-based tool, offering a user-friendly platform for exploring immune responses and vaccine efficacy without programming expertise. The VaxGO tool is available at https://github.com/wapsyed/VaxGO.
