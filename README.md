RNAseq is crucial for investigating transcriptional patterns in immunology, especially within immunization research. However, RNAseq data analysis often requires programming skills, which can restrict access for researchers without such expertise.We introduce VaxGO, a tool designed to facilitate the analysis of differentially expressed genes in the context of immune processes and cells during vaccination. This tool integrates data from Gene Ontology, CellMarker 2.0, the MSigDB Vax collection, and other key studies, including transcriptional atlases of vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases. VaxGO is an interactive, web-based tool, offering a user-friendly platform for exploring immune responses and vaccine efficacy without programming expertise.
